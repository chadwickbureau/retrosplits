# retrosplits

This dataset contains historical playing data from Major League Baseball (tm),
disaggregated at various levels.  These are based on the files
produced by Retrosheet.  This version of the dataset is based on the
June 2015 Retrosheet release.

There are two main groupings of files:
* daybyday: Game-by-game records for players and teams, for all seasons
  available from Retrosheet.
* splits: Various batting and pitching splits generated from event-level
  data, that is, which cannot be computed from the game-by-game records.
  This covers 1974 through present, for which Retrosheet has full
  play-by-play coverage.

The underlying data is obtained free of charged from and is copyrighted
by Retrosheet.  Interested parties may contact Retrosheet at
www.retrosheet.org.
